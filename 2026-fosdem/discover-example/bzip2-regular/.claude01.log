> bzip2.callgraph02.drawio defines a graph with nodes and edges. Nodes are identified by IDs and they display names. The first node is "9-fiPwryRFgu3BFYpyWo-1" with name "countHardLinks". bzip2-nm-libc.log is a list of names. For each name in the list, find the node in 
bzip2.callgraph02.drawio, get the ID, delete all edges that refer to this ID and then delete the node as well. 
  ⎿  ⧉ Selected 1 lines from bzip2.callgraph02.drawio in Visual Studio Code

⏺ I'll help you remove nodes and their associated edges from the graph for each name in the list. Let me start by reading both files to understand their structure.

⏺ Read(bzip2-nm-libc.log)
  ⎿  Read 46 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Read(bzip2.callgraph02.drawio)
  ⎿  Error: File content (80421 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). Please use offset and limit parameters to read specific portions of the file, or use the GrepTool to search for specific content.

⏺ Let me search for the structure of nodes and edges in the drawio file to understand the format:

⏺ Search(pattern: "value="chmod"", path: "bzip2.callgraph02.drawio", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Search(pattern: "value="countHardLinks"", path: "bzip2.callgraph02.drawio", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Let me check the actual structure by reading a portion of the file:

⏺ Read(bzip2.callgraph02.drawio)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now I understand the structure. Let me use a script to process this efficiently. I'll create a Python script to:
  1. Parse the drawio XML file
  2. For each name in the list, find matching nodes by their value attribute
  3. Delete edges that reference those node IDs
  4. Delete the nodes themselves
